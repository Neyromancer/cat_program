# cat_program
reimplementation_of_standart_Linux_cat_command

all standard functions of cat command will be reimplemented with
an additional feature of highlighting lines with colour.

User can choose wich lines should be hightlighted, e.g.
every 2nd line, every 3d and so on. 

Flag can look like -c[lines]: 

-c - default option, stays for every 2nd line to be colored ( the same as -c2 )

-c3 - every 3d line to be colored
